I got up, wrote two essays, handled package transport, handled apartment and SIM business, then went to get an Orange SIM set up, then began to study for a Rao test, then went had another essay to return to. But, I'm almost in the clear for three courses, and then I'll have only one course and a TAship to worry about... if only!</p>

                            <p>Today, we visited the Museum of the Second World War. This museum focused much on
                                Poland's involvement during the war. Afterwards, a few of my peers expressed shock at
                                how war permeats every aspect of one's life. I have to wonder if they hadn't made the
                                connection prior about the US' crimes in the middle east.</p>
                            <p>The museum also focused much on the Soviet Union during WWII, which goes entirely
                                unemphasized in US education.</p>
                            <p>After taking time to process this and recent events in the US, I hopped onboard a boat
                                and watched the sunset from the Baltic Sea, befriending two women enjoying their weekend
                                and dancing to folk music. Sometimes, you just need to listen to the water and be out in
                                fresh, open air.</p>

                                <p>Gdansk is very cozy. I think I needed the comfortable break that this town allows,
                                    given everything that's happening in my personal life. I had a great dinner with
                                    friends, though it felt like being dunked into cold water at times when confronted
                                    with the antisocial, egoist mindset highly promoted in the US. For the record, it's
                                    not a fun mindset to be in.</p>

                                <p>I'm glad that this museum didn't simplify jewish history down to WWII. The textbooks
                                    that I grew up with tended to do so, and I only really learned anything outside of
                                    that from direct discussion online. That's also how I learned anything about most of
                                    the world, but nonetheless. I'm very relieved from this. I wish that Ashley Sankey
                                    had been able to walk through this museum, as well. Maybe one day.</p>
                                <p>I collected the (probable) last pieces of the series that I've been collecting in
                                    different languages throughout my travel. The comic store was hidden away down in
                                    the metro station.</p>

                                    because I misread a single number.</p>
                                <p>I never in a million years expected to actually get into Tartu's program, and I'm
                                    going to have to take out a very small loan. This is absolutely nothing compared to
                                    what Miami is doing to me financially, so I'm pretty much incapable of stressing
                                    over that, but it's definitely going to be a busy moment while I'm back in the US
                                    between MUDEC and Tartu. </p>
                                <p>I need to change banks back in the states, too. The issues that I've had throughout
                                    this trip have been comical. This last incident was actually following a procedure
                                    that would make sense if not for one tiny detail, which is an oversight that I can
                                    (for once) understand. Each of the others was simply the bank not following clear,
                                    numerical instructions.</p>

                                <p>I got a recommendation to skip my week in centering in Utrecht and checking out
                                    different digital ethics MS programmes; definitely not following that
                                    recommendation. Changing the flight date would actually be more expensive than that
                                    entire week's living.</p>
                                <p>I am just a little pre-stressed about Dr. Rao's class starting during my finals week.
                                    Given financial restraints and how hardcore I hit travel during the program, I might
                                    use the weekend as my MUDEC study time; Rao's will almost definitely instantly take
                                    over during that week, but that still doesn't mean that I can just sit back on three
                                    entire other courses during their finals.</p>
                                <p>Taking Dr. Rao's class, working as a remote teaching assistant for Dr. Alomari in
                                    software engineering, and learning about how to construct digital governments and
                                    democracy well. During some and between others, the loan and another personal

                                    sure does feel like I accidentally picked it up during Spring 2021.</p>
                                <p>I have such a busy summer still ahead.</p>

                                <p>This morning, I got to see the fun result of three classes in six weeks combined with
                                    a 6 hour time difference in the class that I'm TAing for. A flurry of work in essays
                                    and exams over the last few days meant that I needed to really remember that this is
                                    a several-week marathon.</p>
                                <p>Teaching assistants aren't paid enough. More broadly, university student positions
                                    don't pay enough and it's exploitation. What really gets me is that the people I
                                    work under seem to agree, but student employment policy has extremely low caps.</p>
